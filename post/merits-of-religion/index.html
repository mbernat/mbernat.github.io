  <h1>Merits of religion</h1>

<p>I used to be a rather vehement atheist. I just could not comprehend
why anyone would prefer vague, contradictory, and obsolete belief
systems to the beauty of science and logic, which are clearly the
superior tools for learning about the world and organizing the
knowledge. While I think no less of science, I&rsquo;m beginning to see the
value of art and religion when grappling with the human condition.</p>

<p>I started to be particularly interested in less rational approaches
when it dawned on me that logic brings me no closer to understanding
others or&mdash;and this was a shock&mdash;even myself.</p>

<h2 id="the-beliefs-of-others">The beliefs of others</h2>

<p>It is always jarring when you meet a person with a worldview wildly
different from your own. My instictive reaction used to be &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
wrong with them?&ldquo;; this is not a particularly healthy attitude. Still,
you can get through life by living in a bubble like this, surrounded
by like-minded individuals and hating or ignoring everybody else, and
this works just fine for many people.</p>

<p>My first approach to understanding beliefs was through the lens of
memes&mdash;that is ideas using people as their vehicles to replicate and
multiply; not unlike viruses. In this model the innocent minds are
unwittingly infected by such memes, no matter their validity. The
reasons for this phenomenon include the absence of fact-checking, the
inflation of social status, and a sense of group identity.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-memes">Beyond memes</h3>

<p>While the above paints wide and clean strokes of understanding the
picture is far from complete. A person&rsquo;s worldview is not explained by
any particular idea they might believe. It is instead constructed and
continually rehashed, largely subliminally, as an an amalgam of all
the ideas that come their way; or the ideas they like (given their
natural predilections), anyway.</p>

<p>I was happy with this description awhile. It makes it much easier to
accept the fact that other minds can be quite different from your own;
it can also guide you to a better argumentation by isolating
particular beliefs at the root of a disagreement and using them to
your advantage (just be careful&mdash;as Peterson points out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-wWBGo6a2w&amp;list=PL22J3VaeABQD_IZs7y60I3lUrrFTzkpat&amp;index=1">his
lectures on belief
systems</a>
people become quite sensitive when you poke them at their axioms).</p>

<h2 id="the-chaos-within">The chaos within</h2>

<p>Returning back to science and logic, I have a confession to make: I am
as irrational as anybody and more pretentious than most. Grokking how
hypocritical I&rsquo;d been my whole life lead to a bit of an identity
crisis. You see, attaining a bit of knowledge and an affinity to
formal reasoning makes it rather easy to argue for almost any
conclusion, even a wrong one, in some sense exacerbating all the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive
biases</a> that
are so scary to begin with.</p>

<p>This was deeply troubling to me. For most of my life I believed
rationality would not lead me astray but I had to admit a defeat; and
like <a href="http://nfs.sparknotes.com/lear/page_82.html">the old Lear</a> pray
I would not go mad. While rationality is quite desirable there is
clearly much more that goes on in our minds, profoundly affecting
everything we do.</p>

<h2 id="the-elder-weapons">The elder weapons</h2>

<p>Surprisingly and luckily, in some ways I had begun searching for
alternatives even before rationality betrayed me.</p>

<h3 id="religion">Religion</h3>

<p>I believe religion is one possible answer to these problems. It
observes and codifies common patterns of those beneath-the-surface
thoughts that our ancestors struggled with no less than we do. They
had tried and by and large succeeded to isolate social and
psychological rules for a longer and a happier live.</p>

<p>Naturally, many of those rules are somewhat or completely obsolete in
the modern world. But many of them are still relevant and <em>all</em> of
them offer important insights into the human psyche. That, to me, is
the main reason why it&rsquo;s still important to study religious texts,
even after all this time; especially for atheists!</p>

<h3 id="art">Art</h3>

<p>Another way to understand our species is through arts. Now, while art
and the process of its creation can be quite logical and scientific,
its core&mdash; the inspiration that drives it, the sense of beauty when
we perceive it, the feelings of divinity and unity when we enjoy it
together&mdash;lies definitely outside the realm of rationality and in
many ways speaks to our animals within.</p>

<h3 id="narrative">Narrative</h3>

<p>Words, while worth only a thousandth of an average picture, are at the
very core of what makes us human. A good story can make you appreciate
the viewpoint of people with very different backgrounds like nothing
else can. I would venture a guess that the main reason Shakespeare is
still so revered is precisely because of his deep insights into the
human nature, no matter his wordsmithing skills (unparalleled as they
may be).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So this is where I am now, at the crossroads of science and art and
religion. There is much that I don&rsquo;t know but that is okay&mdash;wearing
my irrational helmet and my algebraic cape I can face the storm.</p>
