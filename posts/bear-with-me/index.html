<p>Language is a fascinating organism. It might seems rigid, especially after consulting a grammar book or a dictionary, but over millenia it mutates and adapts, both randomly and through the need to describe new objects.</p>

<p>Today, we&rsquo;ll talk bears.</p>

<h1 id="going-back">Going back</h1>

<p>Where do they come from? My standard approach is to consult the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bear">wiktionary</a>, which tells us the word comes from Proto-Germanic <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/ber%C3%B4">*berô</a>, an ancestor also to <strong>beer</strong> (Dutch), <strong>Bär</strong> (German) and <strong>bjørn</strong> (Danish). The Proto-Germanic word, in turn, either came from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) *<strong>bʰerH-</strong> (grey, brown) or, alternatively, *<strong>ǵʰwer-</strong> (wild animal).</p>

<p>This is all fun but it doesn&rsquo;t tell us what the PIE word for bear is. We can try a different modern language and trace the origin of bear there. I happen to speak Slovak and there the word is <strong>medveď</strong>. It comes from the Proto-Slavic <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/medv%C4%9Bd%D1%8C">*medvědь</a>, which derives from a compound of *<strong>medъ</strong> and‎ *<strong>(j)ěsti</strong>, a honey eater. The descendants are <strong>medvédʹ</strong> (Russian) and <strong>niedźwiedź</strong> (Polish), among others.</p>

<p>We hit a dead end again, still no PIE word for bear. No matter. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oso#Spanish">El oso</a> is how you say bear in Spanish. This comes from <strong>ursus</strong> (Latin), <strong>orssos</strong> (Proto-Italic), and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%82%C5%95%CC%A5t%E1%B8%B1os">*h₂ŕtḱos</a> (PIE). Finally!</p>

<h1 id="he-who-must-not-be-named">He Who Must Not Be Named</h1>

<p>Word *<strong>h₂ŕtḱos</strong> gave birth to bears <strong>ari</strong> (Albanian), <strong>ḫar-tág-ga-aš</strong> (Hittite), <strong>arǰ</strong> (Armenian), <strong>art</strong> (Old Irish), <strong>άρκτος</strong> (Greek), <strong>ṛ́kṣa</strong> (Sanskrit), as well as <strong>ours</strong>, <strong>orso</strong>, <strong>urs</strong> (various Romance languages). That&rsquo;s a lot! Now, let&rsquo;s look at the bear populations.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Ursus_arctos_range_map.svg" alt="Bear populations" /></p>

<p>What do you know, it tends to live in Germanic and Slavic lands! It seems the word fell out of use only in these places. The theory why this happened is <a href="https://www.charlierussellbears.com/LinguisticArchaeology.html">taboo avoidance</a>. Bear can be a powerful enemy and by uttering its name, you might summon it to your doorstep. Not only that, the PIE word for bear is related to words which mean destroying or destruction. Thus people had to find other names so that they don&rsquo;t speak of the devil.</p>
