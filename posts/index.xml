      <description>Language is a fascinating organism. It might seems rigid, especially after consulting a grammar book or a dictionary, but over millenia it mutates and adapts, both randomly and through the need to describe new objects.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk bears.
Going back Where do they come from? My standard approach is to consult the wiktionary, which tells us the word comes from Proto-Germanic *berô, an ancestor also to beer (Dutch), Bär (German) and bjørn (Danish).</description>
